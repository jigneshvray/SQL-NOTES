## The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

# When safe mode is enabled then we need to define id as well.

# We can disable safe mode using below command.

# set  sql_safe_updates = 0;  

// 0 = disable
// 1 = enabled

# statement :   UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;

SAFE UPDATE IS A GOOD PRACTISE.
