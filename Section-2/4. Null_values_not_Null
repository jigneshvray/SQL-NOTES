## A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

If a field in a table is optional, it is possible
to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.

## Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value
         or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!

IS NULL 
IS NOT NULL

For example :    While inserting record if we do not pass any one parameter that field be consider as null. However, primary key can not be null.
